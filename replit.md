Image upload for all image fields. Homepage (`app/page.tsx`) reads ALL CMS fields dynamically (background, bilingual titles, features, steps, contact links).

Student HomeworkTab completely rewritten: per-question display with appropriate inputs, file uploads per question, progress bar. `isActive` hard gate removed (now soft warning). Teacher DELETE route fixed to work for both session-based and direct teacherId assignments. Backward-compatible with old single-type assignments.
